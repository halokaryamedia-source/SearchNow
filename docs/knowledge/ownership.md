Tauri commands must remain adapters over `State<SearchNowBackendRuntime>`. Queue lifecycle, network policy, catalog validation, provider composition/resolution/session state, diagnostics, persistence, filesystem, package, and Minecraft behavior belong in RustCore rather than IPC wrappers or Svelte pages.

`app_runtime.rs` owns application composition, **not the underlying domain logic**. `diagnostics.rs` owns only safe bounded observability. `provider_adapter/runtime.rs` owns integrated-provider composition, `provider_session/runtime.rs` owns session coordination, `catalog/provider.rs` owns catalog coordination, `resolver.rs` owns runtime resource resolution, and `http.rs` owns HTTP mechanics. Tauri must not reconstruct those owners independently.

## Legacy evidence

Legacy BlueCoin behavior remains under `docs/legacy/` and is evidence only. It does not own SearchNow implementation behavior.
